        <h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>

        <h3>Advisory Services Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Wisory Global provides strategic advisory and consulting services only.</strong> Our
          recommendations, analyses, reports, and other deliverables are provided for informational and
          guidance purposes. They should not be construed as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Advice:</strong> Our services do not constitute legal counsel. We are not a law
            firm, and our personnel are not licensed attorneys. For legal matters, including but not limited
            to company formation, regulatory compliance, contract drafting, intellectual property, employment
            law, and litigation, you should consult qualified legal professionals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tax or Accounting Advice:</strong> Our financial guidance and cost modeling do not
            constitute professional tax or accounting advice. For tax planning, audit requirements, statutory
            filings, and accounting matters, you should engage certified public accountants or tax advisors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Investment Advice:</strong> Any financial projections, market analyses, or business
            valuations we provide are for strategic planning purposes only and should not be relied upon
            as investment advice. Consult licensed financial advisors for investment decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>No Guarantee of Results</h3>
        <p>
          While we strive to provide accurate, current, and valuable advice based on our expertise and
          market knowledge, we cannot guarantee specific outcomes or results. Business success depends on
          numerous factors beyond our control, including market conditions, execution quality, competitive
          dynamics, regulatory changes, and client-specific circumstances.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Accuracy</h3>
        <p>
          The information provided in our deliverables, reports, and on this website is based on data
          available at the time of preparation. Market conditions, regulations, costs, and other factors
          can change rapidly. We recommend verifying critical information independently and updating
          analyses as circumstances evolve.
